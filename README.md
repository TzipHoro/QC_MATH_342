# MATH 390.4/342w Spring 2020
## Data Science via Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling

This course follows topics such as:
*  Philosophy of modeling and learning using data
*  Prediction via the ordinary linear model including orthogonal projections, sum of squares identity, R2, and RMSE
*  Polynomial and interaction regressions 
*  Prediction with machine learning including neural nets (the perceptron), support vector machines and the tree methods CART, bagged trees, and Random Forests
*  Probability estimation using logistic regression, asymmetric cost classifiers, and the ROC / DET performance curves
*  Underfitting vs. overfitting and the bias-variance decomposition / tradeoff
*  Model validation including out of sample techniques such as cross validation and bootstrap validation
*  Correlation vs. causation, causal models, lurking variables, and interpretations of linear model coefficients
*  Extrapolation
